# Object Oriented Programming with C++
Description:
This reflective repository documents my journey through the C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. It explores how I applied course concepts, overcame challenges, and gained valuable insights.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello OOP";
}
```
## Course Details
- **Class Name (Kor):** 객체지향프로그래밍
- **Class Name (Eng):** Object Oriented Programming
- **Class Code:** IGS2130
- **Class Group:** 001

## Class Overview
This course teaches object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques to students who understand the procedural programming techniques of the C++ language. The course covers basic OOP features including class, inheritance, and operator overloading. Laboratory exercises and programming assignments are designed for students' understanding.
